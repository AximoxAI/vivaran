# Goose-Powered Multilingual Voice-Based Feedback System for Psychiatric Care

-----

## 1\. Introduction and Framework Overview

Effective psychiatric care in India, particularly within a **multilingual and multicultural context**, faces significant challenges in collecting **systematic and actionable feedback for clinicians and patients**, ensuring efficient and standardized documentation, and maintaining comprehensive and portable patient profiles. Traditional methods often lack the scalability, analytical depth, and interoperability crucial for robust research, continuous quality improvement, and seamless patient care across diverse geographic locations and healthcare providers.

This framework proposes a novel solution to address these specific gaps through **voice-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and an **integrated digital platform** designed to prioritize **dynamic feedback loops**. The system aims to provide a 360-degree view of communication quality and support clinical workflows.

The core functionalities of this system are:

  * A **Comprehensive Feedback Engine** for both Patients and Doctors.
  * Automated **Consultation Notes Generation** for efficient documentation and study.
  * A **Full Patient Profile** management system for comprehensive, longitudinal records.
  * **Scoring across 17 different communication metrics** in multiple languages, directly informing the feedback.

To create an adaptive and intelligent system capable of responding to the dynamic nature of psychiatric consultations, an **Agentic AI approach** will be adopted. This paradigm views the system as a collection of specialized, goal-oriented AI agents working collaboratively to achieve specific objectives related to health communication, feedback, and documentation. For the robust implementation and orchestration of these agents, a modern framework like **Goose** will be utilized, providing the necessary tools for defining agent behaviors, managing their state, and orchestrating their interactions.

Achieving consistent, accurate, and empathetic responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) in a sensitive domain like mental health, especially across multiple languages, requires precise control over their output. Manual 'prompt engineering' is often inefficient and prone to errors. To ensure high-fidelity communication and feedback generation, we also propose contributing an optimizer similar to the **DSPy framework**, specifically leveraging optimizers like **GEPA (Stochastic Introspective Mini-Batch Ascent)**, which will be utilized. This approach enables the programmatic and automated optimization of LLM prompts, ensuring outputs are consistently aligned with therapeutic goals and evaluation metrics.

## 8\. Technology Stack Recommendations

### Integrated Digital Platform for Consultation Management & Feedback Delivery

The research framework necessitates a cohesive digital platform to facilitate data collection, analysis, and management across the consultation lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on feedback collection and delivery. This platform will encompass the following core components:

#### Agentic AI Orchestration Framework (Goose)

The foundational architecture for our multi-agent system will be built using **Goose**, a robust Python-based framework for developing autonomous agents. Goose provides the necessary abstractions and tools for:

  * **Agent Definition:** Clearly defining each specialized agent (e.g., Audio Processing Agent, Linguistic Understanding Agent, Feedback Analysis Agent, Notes Generation Agent, Scoring & Reporting Agent) with its specific responsibilities and capabilities.
  * **Task Management:** Orchestrating the flow of tasks and information between agents, ensuring seamless execution of the consultation analysis, note generation, and feedback delivery pipeline.
  * **State Management:** Maintaining the context and state of ongoing consultations across various agent interactions.
  * **Tool Integration:** Facilitating the integration of external tools and APIs (e.g., ASR services, LLMs, database interactions) as capabilities for individual agents.
  * **Prompt Optimization Integration within Agents:** Crucially, **Goose agents will be designed to embed and manage their own prompt optimization processes similar to DSPy.** This means that individual agents responsible for LLM-driven tasks (such as the Linguistic Understanding Agent for interpreting complex queries, the Notes Generation Agent for summarization, or the Feedback Analysis Agent for generating actionable insights) will utilize programmatic prompting and optimization capabilities directly. This allows each agent to continuously refine its prompts and internal behaviors based on feedback and performance metrics relevant to its specific task, all while operating within the overarching Goose framework.
  * **Flexibility and Scalability:** Enabling modular development and future scaling of the agent ecosystem as new functionalities or languages are added.

Goose's structured approach to agent development is critical for managing the complexity of a system designed for nuanced psychiatric communication and comprehensive data processing, particularly for its feedback mechanisms.

  * **Preprocessing:** Noise reduction, normalization
  * **Segmentation:** Speaker diarization for doctor-patient separation

#### 8.2. Analysis Platforms

  * **Speech Analytics:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API (supports Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu)
  * **Sentiment Analysis:** Multilingual BERT models fine-tuned for Indian languages
  * **Cultural Analysis:** Custom NLP models trained on Indian healthcare data
  * **Prompt Optimization Framework (DSPy GEPA):** For the systematic and automated optimization of LLM prompts within the Agentic AI framework, we propose leveraging optimizers similar to **GEPA (Stochastic Introspective Mini-Batch Ascent)** from the DSPy framework. GEPA is known for its effectiveness in iteratively refining prompts and few-shot examples for complex tasks, often outperforming manual prompt engineering. It learns optimal prompt instructions and demonstrations by evaluating model performance against labeled data (e.g., from our native speaker evaluation panels and patient feedback), making it ideal for the nuanced and high-stakes environment of psychiatric communication. This will ensure that our AI agents' outputs (e.g., notes, feedback, communication generation) are consistently optimized for empathy, therapeutic tone, accuracy, cultural sensitivity, clarity, and coherence across diverse linguistic contexts. This optimization will be integrated as an internal mechanism within relevant Goose agents (e.g., the Linguistic Understanding Agent, Notes Generation Agent, Feedback Analysis Agent, Scoring & Reporting Agent) to automatically optimize their LLM-driven behaviors and improve their specific contributions to the overall system's goals.
  * The insights derived from speech analytics, sentiment analysis, and cultural analysis will directly contribute to the **automated generation of consultation notes** and the enrichment of the **patient profile**, as well as the **calculation of metrics for feedback.**
  * **Scoring & Reporting Engine:** A dedicated module or framework responsible for calculating and aggregating scores across the 17 distinct metrics. This agent will directly consume outputs from the Linguistic Understanding, Audio Processing, and Feedback Analysis Agents, and is crucial for generating the detailed performance feedback provided to doctors and patients.

#### 8.3. Digital Feedback & Patient Management System (The App)

A **custom-built, secure, and multilingual digital platform (mobile application and/or web interface)** will serve as the central hub for:

  * **Integrated Feedback Engine:** A user-friendly interface for both patients and doctors to provide structured feedback post-consultation. This includes:
      * **Patient Feedback:** Scales (e.g., Jefferson Scale of Empathy, CARE Measure), open-ended comments on communication clarity, empathy, understanding, and overall satisfaction.
      * **Doctor Feedback:** Assessment of patient engagement, communication effectiveness, challenges faced, and self-assessment of their communication skills, contributing to their learning journey. This feedback is a core data source for the system.

This directly addresses the critical challenge of **fragmented patient data and the lack of portability** when patients "shift place," ensuring continuity of care.
  * **Consultation Notes Generation:** An intelligent module that processes transcribed audio, leverages NLP and psychiatric knowledge, and automatically generates structured, summarized consultation notes. These notes can supplement and contextualize the feedback provided.
  * **Consent Management:** Robust, granular, and multilingual consent mechanisms for audio recording, data storage, sharing, and research use, embedded directly within the platform.
  * **Security & Privacy:** Paramount importance given sensitive health data. Implement end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, secure authentication, and adherence to data protection regulations like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act), HIPPA etc.
